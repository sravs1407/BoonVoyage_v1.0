**Problem Statement:**
Ensure Personal Safety and provide Essential Services needed while Traveling, using a platform.

Traveling is an essential part of our lives, whether it's a necessary commute to a work location or a fun ride with friends, be it a long road trip to Ladakh or a short ride to a village nearby.

We face a lot of problems such as a vehicle getting a flat tire, concerns about individual safety at night, being involved in a serious crash, running out of fuel midway, or getting lost in an unknown place.

We aim to address and solve these problems using the technology at our disposal. Our goal is to ensure safety and provide essential services through a platform-as-a-service that brings together a network of people.
